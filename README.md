# mirrord Demo Repository - Let's Talk Dev YouTube Video

Welcome to the mirrord Demo repository! This repository includes a demonstration of using mirrord to develop and debug a Kubernetes application as if it were running on your local machine.

## Video
This repository is part of the video on Let's Talk Dev where I demonstrate how to use mirrord by MetalBear to develop and debug a Kubernetes application. Watch the video on YouTube:

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and Kubernetes manifests used in Let's Talk Dev's video where mirrord by MetalBear is demonstrated. It also contains a sample Go application.
With mirrord, you can develop and debug your code directly within a remote Kubernetes cluster without affecting other users.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Rancher Desktop, Minikube, kind etc.) see my video on [using Rancher Desktop for local Kubernetes development](https://youtu.be/UwXaUESSRBY)
- mirrord CLI
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- mirrord VS Code extension
- Go (for the demo application)
